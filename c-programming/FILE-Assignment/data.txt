 Where Did Viruses Come From? 
 There is much debate among virologists about this question.
 Three main hypotheses have been articulated: 
 1. The progressive, or escape, hypothesis states that viruses arose from genetic elements that gained the ability to move between cells; 
2. the regressive, or reduction, hypothesis asserts that viruses are remnants of cellular organisms;
 and 3. the virus-first hypothesis states that viruses predate or coevolved with their current cellular hosts.
